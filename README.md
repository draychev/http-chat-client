# http-chat-client

This is an extremely simple HTTP Chat Client.

## Principles:
  - everything in one file (ok, maybe two or three)
  - no Javascript
  - no unnecessary features

Run it with: `go run ./http-chat-client.go`


- Server: [github.com/draychev/http-chat-server](https://github.com/draychev/http-chat-server)
- Client: [github.com/draychev/http-chat-client](https://github.com/draychev/http-chat-client)

The CSS theme used here is inspired by https://jcs.org/
